### Understanding t-swap protocol

pool factory contract helps us create pools of tokens (each pool is a pair of `weth X erc20 token`) 

the t-swap-pool contract will facilitate the exchange between the weth and erc20 tokens and will have the logic to balance the pools


### Testing

Fuzzing/Fuzz test ---> stateless fuzz testing

Here we give random input to a particular function

Invariance -----> statefull fuzz testing

here we give random data to random functions
